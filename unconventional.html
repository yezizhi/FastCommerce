        <p class="card-text">
          Dropshipping is a business model primarily used by e-commerce retailers that do not stock To balance
          inventory, prices, and promotions, retail businesses throw clearance sales.
          It is a promotional strategy to attract price-conscious consumers and an effective inventory management tool.
          Retail store clearances can be a great source of inventory for eCommerce sellers.

        <p class="card-text">
          Facebook is an online marketplace where you can find a lot of deals on wholesale products.
          Facebook marketplaces consist of local buy and sell groups that are ideal to source inventory for your
          FastCommerce online store.
          You can search your neighborhood and local areas for buy and sell trade or garage sales.
          Look for items that you know about or are interested in reselling on your eBay store.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          You can negotiate with sellers on the Facebook marketplace.
          The more often you source inventory from sellers on the Facebook marketplace, you will be building better
          relationships with them and can get better deals and offers.

        <p class="card-text">
          The global handicrafts and Do-It-Yourself market were valued at an estimate of
          <a href="https://www.expertmarketresearch.com/reports/handicrafts-market"
            class="text-blue text-decoration-none" target="_blank">$647 billion</a>
          in the year 2020. The global handicrafts market comprises solo artisans, jewelry makers, weavers, carpenters,
          and so on.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          If you are someone who makes your products for sale, you do not have to look elsewhere to source your
          inventory.
          Another innovative inventory to sell on your FastCommerce store is DIY kits and supplies. Customers enjoy
          making crafts of their own using kits sold in the market.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Selling DIY products means that you can have complete control over your product design, quality, and
          inventory.
          Handicrafts and DIY products are in a class by themselves and there is a growing market for unique collections
          amidst the mass-production economy.

        <h1 class="card-title mb-4">Thrift and Goodwill Stores</h1>
        <p class="card-text">Thrift stores sell pre-owned and upcycled or thrifted clothes, accessories, and other
          goods. These stores sell gently used products at reduced prices. It is a great way to purchase sustainable
          goods to resell in your store.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Many Goodwill stores have online shops where goods are sold at auction. Some Goodwills have
          their shops up on eBay. Others have their own sites like <a href="https://www.goodwillsocal.org/"
            class="text-blue text-decoration-none" target="_blank">Goodwill Southern California</a>.</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          If you want to source your inventory from thrift stores, research the internet and social media for them.
          Be specific about your keywords if you have a particular item of interest that you’d like to source for your
          store.
          Make sure to source thrifted products from authentic stores.
          This will help ensure that you receive goods in a good condition that you can resell for a decent profit
          margin.

        <p class="card-text">Live auction items are sold by established, well known auction houses. Each auction house
          is an independent seller, curating their own items and events.</p>
        <p class="card-text">There are many auction sites such as</p>

        <p class="card-text">Whatnot is a social marketplace where people host live shows to sell things. It started as
          a place to sell Funko Pop items but is now popular for much more like vintage and thrifted items.</p>
        <p class="card-text">People buy items by bidding on them as part of a live auction. Once on the platform, you
          can follow categories and sellers that you like. You can often preview what’s going to be sold on a show and
          sometimes even purchase it at a set price beforehand.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Many resellers have been sourcing on Whatnot in the past year or so. Prices start low
          because of the auction setup. Items tend to sell for less than they do on other platforms, meaning it’s
          cheaper for you to source there.</p>
        <p class="card-text">While bidding, it’s good to have a maximum price for each item in mind so that you don’t
          get carried away bidding.</p>

          whatever they find of value inside.</p>
        <p class="card-text">You usually aren’t able to see what’s inside because most bidding is done online
          nowadays. You only see what's in the pictures but might spot something of interest and can look up the resale
          cost right away.</p>
        <p class="card-text">

        <p class="card-text">Pawn shops receive their goods from people looking for loans. People put up their items of
          value in exchange for the loan. If they don’t pay back the loan on time, the pawn shop keeps the item and
          sells it.</p>
        <p class="card-text">You won’t find clothes at pawn shops, but you can find other items like jewelry, luxury
          brand purses, and electronics. Be careful about purchasing jewelry online unless you’re knowledgeable about
          jewelry, it’s been authenticated, or you see markings indicating the quality of the piece (e.g., 18k stamp on
          the inside of a ring).</p>
        <p class="card-text">Don’t forget that you can get an even better deal by negotiating price and paying in cash.

        <p class="card-text">Liquidated items are those that were initially sold at traditional retailers like Macys and
          JCPenney in their stores online. These are often items that went unsold, customer returns, and overstocked
          items.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Seasons and styles change and companies need to move these unsellable products for new
          stock. Companies sell them off in bulk at deep discounts to liquidation companies to get rid of them. These
          liquidation companies pass on their goods to you at a low cost.</p>
        <p class="card-text">There are many liquidation companies out there and seemingly new ones popping up each day.
          These are a few that are popular with resellers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quicklots</li>
          <li>Jomar</li>
          <li>Bulq</li>
          <li>Boutique by the box</li>
          <li>Liquidation.com</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="card-text">Some sellers go-to source is discount retail stores like Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx,
          Marshalls, Last Call, Ross, etc. These stores are known for selling new items for a fraction of retail.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Where do the stores get these items? They may be last season’s items, leftovers, and
          returned items from full-price retail stores.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Some stores like TJ Maxx contract with brands to make goods to sell only at those discount
          stores. The goods might be a little lower quality or slightly different in style but still have the brand name
          that people want to wear.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The clearance rack is a great place to start. Go during certain times of the year like
          during the Clear the Racks sales at Nordstrom Rack and you’ll find the items discounted even more.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Consignment shops are similar to curated second-hand shops. An employee inspects items that
          people bring in and selects only those likely to resell.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The consignment store displays the item for a certain length of time like 1-3 months. If it
          sells, the shop takes part of the sale as commission. Fifty percent commission is normal. If it doesn’t, they
          may lower the price of the item or return it to the original owner.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Because items are all closely inspected and chosen for their ability to resell, you’ll come
          across better quality items and brands than you would at a thrift store.</p>

          like Crossroads, Buffalo Exchange, and Plato’s Closet. People bring their clothing to these stores to sell in

        <p class="card-text">Employees inspect each item and accept only the ones they think will sell. Because these
          stores curate what they sell and are for-profit, their prices are higher than you’d find at thrift stores.</p>
