      <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold text-center">Terms of Service</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>By using the Services provided by Fast Commerce, you are entering into an agreement (the "Agreement") outlined
        in these Terms of Service and Our Privacy Policy. This Agreement defines the terms and conditions governing Your
        utilization of the https://www.fastcommerce.com website and the various products and services accessible through
        Us, including the platform, applications, tools, templates, and more (collectively referred to as the
        "Services"). These Services empower you to create and publish websites, online stores, and access other
        e-commerce services, collectively referred to as "Your Sites." You, the Customer, are referred to as "Customer,"
        "You," or "Your" within this Agreement.</p>
      <h5 class="fw-bold">1. Account, Contact and Account Ownership</h5>
      <p>To access and utilize our Services, you are required to complete the registration process for an account
        (referred to as the "Account"). During registration, you must provide accurate information, including your full
        legal name, current address, phone number, a valid email address, and any other information indicated as
        mandatory. We will primarily use the email address you provide for communication, including matters related to
        billing. Please note that we reserve the right to reject your Account application at our sole discretion.</p>
      <p>As part of your account setup, you are expected to designate a single "Point of Contact" who holds full
        authority to enter into agreements and make binding decisions on your behalf. For security purposes, only the
        Account owner or the designated Point of Contact may make changes to the account or appoint a new Point of
        Contact. You agree that we may rely on the representations made by your Point of Contact, and you have the
        flexibility to change the Point of Contact at any time. In cases where there is reasonable doubt regarding the
        authenticity of any instruction, notice, document, or communication, we maintain the right to request additional
        authentication from you.
      </p>
      <p>Keeping your password secure is crucial. We strongly encourage you to follow best practices for creating,
        regularly updating, and securing your password. We will not be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from
        your failure to maintain the security of your Account or password. It is your responsibility to promptly inform
        us of any unauthorized use of your password or any security breach.</p>
      <p>In the event of a dispute concerning Account ownership, we retain the right to request documentation to verify
        and confirm ownership. Such documentation may include a copy of your business license or charter, a
        government-issued photo ID, the last four digits of the credit card on file, and more. We reserve the discretion
        to determine rightful Account ownership and may transfer an Account to the rightful owner. If we are unable to
        reasonably establish rightful ownership of an Account, we may temporarily disable the Account until a resolution
        is reached between the disputing parties.</p>
      <h5 class="fw-bold">2. Our Products and Services</h5>
      <p>We will grant you access to the Services that you have subscribed to or purchased through your Account
        (referred to as the "Purchased Services"). The Purchased Services encompass hosting for your Sites and the
        content they contain, which can be accessed by visitors and users of your Sites (referred to as "Your End
        Users").</p>
      <p>For the protection of our other customers, we reserve the right to take measures like quarantining one or more
        of your Sites, controlling traffic, or implementing other necessary techniques. The duration of such actions
        will be determined by us to safeguard the interests of our other customers and won't include additional support.
        If any of your Sites becomes the target of a DDoS or similar attack, you authorize us to implement mitigation
        procedures with or without prior notice, without assuming any liability for any delays, disruptions, or service
        interruptions. These measures will remain in place until your Site experiences at least 48 hours of
        uninterrupted, non-malicious, "normal" traffic.</p>
      <p>Technical support is exclusively available to paying Account holders, as specified in the purchased plan.</p>
      <p>We maintain the right to provide our Services to your competitors and do not guarantee exclusivity in any
        market segment. Additionally, you recognize that our employees and contractors may also be our customers and may
        compete with you, while refraining from using your confidential information for this purpose.</p>
      <p>We reserve the discretion to refuse, modify, or suspend any part of our Services to anyone, for any reason,
        without prior notice. While we are not obliged to do so, we may remove materials, suspend or terminate Accounts
        or Agreements if we determine, at our sole discretion, that the goods, services, or materials offered via a
        store, or the materials uploaded or posted to a store, violate our Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") or these Terms
        of Service. FastCommerce does not commit to pre-screen any goods, services, or materials uploaded or posted to a
        store.</p>
      <p>Any form of verbal or written abuse directed toward any FastCommerce customer, employee, member, or officer,
        including threats of abuse or retribution, may result in immediate suspension or termination of your Account, at
        our sole discretion.</p>
      <h5 class="fw-bold">3. Your Website Content</h5>
      <p>Our Products and Services enable you and your End Users to upload, post, transmit, publish, share, store, or
        manage various types of content, collectively referred to as 'Your Content.' You bear sole responsibility for
        all your Content and confirm that (i) you possess all necessary rights to distribute your content through our
        Services, and (ii) Your Content does not infringe upon the rights of any third party. By using our Services, you
        grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to host and utilize Your Content for the purpose of
        providing the Services to you. It is your responsibility to maintain the security, confidentiality, and
        integrity of all Your Content transmitted through or stored on our servers. Any loss or irrecoverability of Your
        Content resulting from your use of the Services is your responsibility.</p>
      <p>Please note that our servers are not intended for archiving, and we hold no liability for any loss, damage, or
        destruction of Your Sites or Your Content. You are solely responsible for backing up Your Sites and Your Content
        and are encouraged to do so regularly.</p>
      <p>We do not pre-screen Your Content and have no obligation to monitor Your Content or other content provided or
        distributed by others. However, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to remove from public view,
        disconnect, or terminate the hosting of any of Your Content if we find it to (i) violate the terms of this
        Agreement, including our Acceptable Use Policy, (ii) infringe upon any third party's intellectual property, or
        (iii) be otherwise objectionable.</p>
      <p>We will not intentionally disclose Your confidential information to third parties, except as required in the
        course of providing Our Services or as described in this Agreement or Our Privacy Policy. Your Confidential
        Information comprises any materials or information provided by you to us that is not publicly known ('Your
        Confidential Information'). However, it does not include information that: (a) was in the public domain when we
        received it; (b) becomes public domain after we received it through no fault of ours; (c) we received from
        someone other than you without a breach of our or their confidentiality obligations; or (d) we are legally
        obligated to disclose.</p>
      <p>To maintain the quality of our Services, you grant consent to our staff accessing your Account, Your Sites, and
        Your Content occasionally to investigate complaints or allegations of abuse and to perform the Services
        described herein.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge that Your Content, with the exception of credit card information or data, may be transmitted
        unencrypted across various networks and may be modified as required to conform to the technical requirements of
        connecting networks or devices. However, credit card information or data is always encrypted during transfer to
        or by us.</p>
      <p>It's important to note that we do not claim ownership or intellectual property rights in Your Content.</p>
      <h5 class="fw-bold">4. Indemnification</h5>
      <p>You unequivocally agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Us, Our affiliates, directors, officers,
        employees, and agents from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, losses,
        damages, costs, and expenses, which may include reasonable attorneys' fees and fees associated with in-house
        legal personnel. These claims and expenses arise from or are related to the following:</p>

          Your End Users.</li>
      </ol>
